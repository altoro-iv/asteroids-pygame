# 🚀 Asteroids Pygame
My take on the classic Asteroids arcade game, built using Python and Pygame. You're a Raptor sent in a ship through space to destroy asteroids heading straight to Earth that could wipe out all dinosaurkind. This is a foundational version of the game with plans for new features and polishing it up as I learn more!

# 🎮 Features
 Player-controlled spaceship

 Basic asteroid spawning and movement

 Player shooting mechanics

 Collision detection between bullets and asteroids

 Game loop with basic win/lose conditions


# 🛠️ In Progress / Planned Features
I'm actively working to expand the game. Here are some features I plan to add:

 Scoring System – Track points for destroying asteroids

 Explosion Effects – Visual feedback when asteroids are destroyed

 Multiple Lives and Respawning – Give the player extra chances

 Screen Wrapping – Objects reappear on the opposite edge

 Acceleration Mechanics – More dynamic movement for the ship

 Background Image – Visual atmosphere

 Bomb Weapon – Drop bombs to clear space

 Weapon Variety – Different types of weapons like rapid fire and spread

 Lumpy Asteroids – Procedurally generate irregular asteroid shapes

 Triangular Hitbox – Improve collision accuracy for the ship

 Speed Power-Up – Temporary boost to ship speed

 Shield Power-Up – Temporary invincibility
